# challenge6
"Recipes box"

## Description
My solution to the challenge 6 from course "Python Masters: 16 Days to Learn Python Programming".

This program is a container for recipes.
Each of the recipes belongs to one of the categories, to make it easier I wrote a bash script to create initial recipes within their respective categories.
Project developed on Linux OS.


User can perform six actions:
- read recipe
- create recipe
- create category
- delete recipe
- delete category
- end program
